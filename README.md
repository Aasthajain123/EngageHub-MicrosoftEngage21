# Major Learnings:
  
1. **Agile Methodology**: Through the 3 week span of the project, I undertook weekly sprints and made sure that small features get implemented in an efficient and time bound manner. Having a usable version of the product from the very beginning and seeing it evolve through the days and weeks was a joyful experience.
2. **Perseverance and debugging skills**: Having faced numerous bugs that seemed *impossible* to solve at first to actually overcoming them felt like victory. It improved my problem solving skills and faith in hardwork.
3. **New Technologies**: The project was a fun introduction to Php, Various front end Technologies and databases for me and I thoroughly enjoyed learning the new technologies. With the help of my friends and mentors as well as self study I was able to grow my knowledge.
